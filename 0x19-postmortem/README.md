# **Postmortem: Web Server Outage**

## **Issue Summary**
- **Duration:** March 10, 2025, 02:30 AM - March 10, 2025, 05:45 AM (UTC)
- **Impact:** Website and API services were completely unavailable. Approximately 85% of users could not access the platform.
- **Root Cause:** A misconfigured Nginx server prevented the application from serving requests properly.

---

## **Timeline**
- **02:30 AM** - Monitoring system detected increased server error rates.
- **02:35 AM** - First alert received via automated monitoring.
- **02:40 AM** - Engineering team notified.
- **02:50 AM** - Initial assumption: database failure.
- **03:10 AM** - Checked database logs, found no issues.
- **03:30 AM** - Debugged API, identified Nginx misconfiguration.
- **04:00 AM** - Configuration corrected; server restarted.
- **05:45 AM** - Full functionality restored.

---

## **Root Cause and Resolution**
### **Root Cause**
The Nginx configuration file contained an incorrect **proxy_pass** directive, which caused the server to route traffic incorrectly. This misconfiguration resulted in all incoming requests failing.

### **Resolution**
- Identified the misconfiguration in the Nginx configuration file.
- Corrected the **proxy_pass** directive.
- Restarted the Nginx service.
- Verified that the API and web services were responding correctly.

---

## **Corrective and Preventative Measures**
### **Improvements Needed**
- Implement stricter CI/CD validation for configuration changes.
- Enhance monitoring alerts to detect misconfigurations earlier.
- Improve team response time to critical alerts.

### **Action Items**
- ✅ Add automated testing for Nginx configurations before deployment.
- ✅ Implement additional API endpoint health checks.
- ✅ Train engineers on troubleshooting Nginx-related issues.
- ✅ Configure failover servers to minimize downtime in future incidents.

---

### **Conclusion**
This incident highlighted the need for better configuration validation and faster debugging processes. The implemented fixes and preventive measures will help ensure similar issues do not occur in the future.

# 🚨 **Postmortem: The Great Nginx Meltdown of 2025** 🚨

## **Issue Summary**
🕒 **Duration:** March 10, 2025, 02:30 AM - March 10, 2025, 05:45 AM (UTC)  
🌍 **Impact:** Our beloved website and API services took an unplanned **vacation** for 3 hours and 15 minutes.  
💥 **Cause:** A misconfigured Nginx server that decided to block **everyone** (even us).  
👥 **Users affected:** 85% of our traffic (including our biggest client, who wasn’t amused).  

🚀 **Translation:** "Server is down, we are panicking, and we need coffee… lots of coffee."  

---

## **Timeline of Disaster (A.K.A. What Went Wrong)**
- **02:30 AM** - Monitoring system pings us: **"Hey, your site is dead. Have fun!"**  
- **02:35 AM** - First engineer wakes up: **"Huh? What? Noooooo…"**  
- **02:40 AM** - Full-blown investigation begins.  
- **02:50 AM** - Initial theory: "It must be the database!" (Spoiler: It wasn’t).  
- **03:10 AM** - Logs checked, database is fine. Panic level increases.  
- **03:30 AM** - Someone finally checks Nginx. **Oh. My. God.**  
- **04:00 AM** - Nginx config file corrected, server restarted.  
- **05:45 AM** - Website is **back**, engineers pass out from exhaustion.  

---

## **Root Cause and Resolution**
### **Root Cause**
📌 The Nginx configuration file had an **incorrect proxy_pass directive**, sending requests into the void. Essentially, our server was talking to itself like an existential crisis.  

### **Resolution**
✅ Fixed the **proxy_pass** directive.  
✅ Restarted Nginx with fingers crossed.  
✅ Performed multiple health checks and confirmed everything was back to normal.  
✅ Sent a formal **apology email** to our biggest client (and maybe a fruit basket).  

---

## **Corrective and Preventative Measures**
### **Lessons Learned**
1. **Double-check Nginx configurations before deployment.** (Seriously, we should know better).  
2. **Better monitoring alerts** for misconfigurations before everything crashes.  
3. **More coffee stockpiled** for next time.  

### **Action Items**
✔️ Add automated tests for Nginx configs.  
✔️ Improve logging to detect future misconfigurations.  
✔️ Train engineers on **"How Not to Break the Internet 101."**  
✔️ Set up a backup server because… well, you never know.

## **Final Thoughts**
If there’s one thing we’ve learned, it’s that **Nginx doesn’t forgive mistakes**. We survived this time, but next time, we might not be so lucky. 🚀  

🔧 **Moral of the story?** Don’t let your server have an identity crisis—check your configs!
